Stokesian Dynamics of Magnetorheoloigical Fluids

This program simulates the dynamics of a suspension of magnetic particles and calculates the rheological properties of magnetorheological (MR) fluids.

The magnetic interactions are modeled by mutual-dipole model and the hydrodynamics are modeled by Stokesian dynamics.
